        <p>“Hi! My name is Anastassia Bianchi and I’m an Italian contemporary abstract artist. Since I  was a child I would express myself in art. Besides participating in every single possible school play or competition, at the age of 7 I  won a price at my school for a painting , that was looking “just as a grown up adult would do it“.</br>Then I studied at the University of arts and culture in one the most beautiful and artistic cities of the world - Saint Petersburg, Russia; but I never finished studying there, because as I felt - what I was studying was not the way I truly  wanted to express myself.</br>For four years I  studied textile design, and my painting routine consisted of very precise and sharp ornaments and textures. My teacher noticed my struggle and suggested me to quit and start painting freelance in the way I would want it. And I did quit.</br>Unfortuntely, for the next 8 years of my life, I would never take a brush in my hand again and would do completely different things. I went into modeling, and gained a pretty ambitions career. I lived in New York, made really great achievements in that area,  when one day I felt like besides I was doing great - something was missing. I would want to express myself, and do something my heart would truly want and desire.</br>And I  remembered that as a child the only thing I would always do, was painting - so I  started to paint again. And this time the way I wanted. And I wanted to paint Abstract”...</br></br>Now Anastassia is gaining her place in the art world. She had several works printed in the best catalogs and galleries would represent her work. Anastassia is a full-time artist working almost every day in her studio in Milan, Italy. And she is happier than ever.
