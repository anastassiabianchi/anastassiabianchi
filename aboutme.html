        <p>“Hi! My name is Anastassia Bianchi and I’m an Italian contemporary abstract artist. Since I  was a child I would express myself in art. Besides participating in every single possible school play or competition, at the age of 7 I  won a price at my school for a painting, that was looking “just as a grown up adult would do it“.</br>Then I studied at the University of arts and culture in one the most beautiful and artistic cities of the world - Saint Petersburg, Russia; but I never finished studying there because as I felt - what I was studying, was not the way I truly wanted to express myself.</br> For four years I learned textile design and my painting routine consisted of very precise and sharp ornaments and textures. My then teacher noticed my struggle and suggested me to quit and start painting freelance the way I would want it. And I did quit.</br> Unfurtunately, then for the next 8 years of my life, I would never take a brush in my hand again and would dedicate myself to completely different things. I went into modeling and gained a pretty ambitions career. Lived in New York , made some achievements in fashion.</br>Then when one day I felt like, besides I was doing great, something was missing. I knew I would want to express myself and do something my heart would truly desire. And I remembered that as a child the only thing I would always do, was painting.</br>And so…I  started to paint again. And this time the way I wanted. And I wanted to paint Abstract“...</br></br>Now Anastassia is gaining her place in the art world, she had several works printed in catalogs, and galleries would represent her work. Anastassia loves working on unprimed canvas and cotton. She hardly follow the rules, and usually paints with anything she consider an instrument. Her works can be very different one from another, and she states that it is because art is something connected to nature, and it can’t be always sunny. Now Anastassia is a full-time artist working almost every day in her studio in Milan, Italy.
